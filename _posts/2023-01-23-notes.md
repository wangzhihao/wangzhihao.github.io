### Questions
1. How to diff two large datasets?
    1. First, how to test the equality? [one anwser](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31197353/dataframe-equality-in-apache-spark)

### Distributed Algorithm
1. sort, see this [interesting post](https://brunomaga.github.io/Distributed-Sort). See [how spark perfom sort](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32887595/how-does-spark-achieve-sort-order), it also uses sample sort.
1. find k-th largest, First, quickselect algorithm can be easily expressed in map/reduce framework. Unrelated but FYI: [Fast Computation of the Median by Successive Binning](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/median.pdf)
1. sort-merge join
1. work-stealing
1. random shuffle, see the [ray implementation][shuffle-with-ray]. Others that might be related [How Distributed Shuffle improves scalability and performance in Cloud Dataflow pipelines][google-shuffle], [Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets][Dremel]

### TCP

To answer questions like what's the difference between FIN-WAIT-1 and
FIN-WAIT-2, we need to understand TCP is distributed. In other words the two
parties have to reason by their own with some unreliable message sharing. For
example, depending on who (the local party or the remote party) want to close
the connection first, you will enter FIN-WAIT-1 or FIN-WAIT-2.

### On piano playing

1. 指尖垂直下键（P23 We must modify the wrist position so that the last phalanx of the finger is able to approximate a perpendicular direction to the key.）
2. P30 Let me warn you against transferring the full weight of the arm to the fingers for an extended period of time. The transfer of weight to fingers should be instantaneous, and the shoulder should immediately resume carrying the full weight of the arm in order to avoid excessive strain on the fingers. It’s simply too much for the fingers to carry the full weight of arm, and it’s harmful to get used to applying pressure on the keys. (那怎么理解支撑？瞬时支撑么？)
3. Horowitz - [The 1968 TV Concert](http://%20https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwBQCU_Fgro)
4. [Beethoven Recital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAiYa15aE6c) - Sviatoslav Richter - (Moscow, 1976)
5. P32 When you move from the white keys to the black keys,  it is necessary to lean slightly forward and to raise the elbow (upper arm) so as to bring the wrist and fingers to an identical or very similar position to that used in playing on white keys.
6. [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k)
7. Rudolf Breithaupt
8. P38 The fact is that the rate of acceleration produced by the force of gravity is exactly the same whether the weight is small or large. (The factor of air resistance is negligible in this situation) ... One might be tempted to rename weight technique as “speed technique“.
9. P40 We must learn not to interfere the acceleration by slowing it down or increasing it with a throw. We must acquire the ability to let any part (or parts) of the arms fall freely as though it were an object that didn’t belong to us.
10. P45 But first we must master it in its original, unaltered form - a premise that is true of any of the basic patterns we are going to investigate... Before we play these patterns quickly, we should practice and master the motions in slow tempo in their purest form.
11. 重量应该仍然有影响，因为碰撞中实际上是动量守恒，而不是速度守恒。 p = m * v 这应该是这本书的谬误。
12. P60 Three adjustments: Horizontal adjustment, Vertical adjustment and In-depth adjustment
13. P60 All non-playing fingers slightly raised.
14. [Interview - György Sandor about technical abilities of todays pianists - The art of piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UdqYg5tMfc)
15. [Scales 2: How to Avoid “Thumb Under” - Synchronization of Shoulders-Arms-Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew4PUlVJuGc)
16. No Thumb Under ([Link](https://www.quora.com/What-piano-thumb-technique-is-better-Thumb-over-or-Thumb-under))
17. P66 grouping
18. P69 abandon the key gradually?
19. P82 It’s a composition motion: one cannot rotate purely by the forearm with the fingers staying passive, nor if the fingers are overactive and the forearm is inactive.
20. P85
