### TCP

To answer questions like why there is 3-way handshake, what's the difference
between FIN-WAIT-1 and FIN-WAIT-2, we need to understand TCP is distributed. In
other words the two parties have to reason by their own with some unreliable
message sharing. For example, depending on who (the local party or the remote
party) want to close the connection first, you will enter FIN-WAIT-1 or
FIN-WAIT-2. the 3-way handshake is basically one party ask access to another
and it replies (SYN ->, ACK <-), which involves two messages. But each party
need do it one time, which results four messages (SYN ->, ACK <-, SYN <-, ACK
->). It can be compressed into (SYN ->, SYN + ACK <-, ACK->) and thus reduce
four messages to three.
